    <strong>Visualizations themselves have become a data format. Akin to other data formats such as text and images, visualizations
    are increasingly created, stored, shared, and (re-)used with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In this survey, we
    probe the underlying vision of formalizing visualizations as an emerging data format and review the recent advance in
    applying AI techniques to visualization data (AI4VIS). We define visualization data as the digital representations of
    visualizations in computers and focus on data visualization (e.g., charts and infographics). We build our survey upon a
    corpus spanning ten different fields in computer science with an eye toward identifying important common interests. Our
    resulting taxonomy is organized around WHAT is visualization data and its representation, WHY and HOW to apply AI to
    visualization data. We highlight a set of common tasks that researchers apply to the visualization data and present a
    detailed discussion of AI approaches developed to accomplish those tasks. Drawing upon our literature review, we discuss
    several important research questions surrounding the management and exploitation of visualization data, as well as the
    role of AI in support of those processes.</strong>
