4,Experiment Design,Assess[Score][ML]|Feature[Engineering][Data],"we trained a machine learning model that learns the perceptual efectiveness of diferent visual designs and evaluated its predictive power across test datasets. To characterize a dataset, we extracted 167 features: These features characterized summary statistics (e.g. coefcient of variance and kurtosis), statistical distributions (e.g. entropy and statistical fts), pairwise relationships (e.g. correlations and one-way ANOVA p-values), clusteredness and spatial autocorrelation."
