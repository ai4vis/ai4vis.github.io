3,FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW,
4,DATA ERRORS AND POSSIBLE REPAIRS,Recommend[Data][Opt],"detect data errors and generate possible repairs to clean visualization"
5,SELECTING COMPOSITE QUESTIONS,
5.1,Estimation-based Benefit Model, Compare[Data][Distance],"It first measures the benefit of asking a CQG by an estimation-based benefit model, where the benefit is associated with the distance {Earth Moverâ€™s Distance} between visualization before/after cleaning the data"
5.2,CQG Selection Algorithm,Recommend[Data][Opt],"we now aim to select the most beneficial CQG from the ERG"
