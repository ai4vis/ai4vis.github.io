6,DIVERSIFIED VISUALIZATIONS SELECTION,Compare[Hybrid][Distance]|Recommend[Hybrid],"we treat the top-k visualizations selection problem as a bi-criteria optimization problem, which considers both the visualization score and diversity. Next we define the diversity in our problem first and then introduce our diversified top-k visualizations selection algorithm"
