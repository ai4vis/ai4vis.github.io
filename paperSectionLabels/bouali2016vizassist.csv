4, The initial suggestion of visualizations,Assess[Score][H]|Recommend[Encoding][Opt],"Themore a visualization will account for the userâ€™s objectives, the higher the score. This algorithm attempts to match the most effective visual attributes with the most important data attributes, with constraints imposed by compatible data types and compatible number of values"
5, Interactive genetic algorithm,Recommend[Encoding][Opt],"We proposed a second interface, which allows the user to adjust and refine the mapping {visual encoding} of the chosen visualization in an interactive manner"
