        <div class="supplymentary">
            We define visualization data as the digital representations of
            visualizations in computers. Visualization data can be stored in
            different content formats such as graphics and programs. The choice
            of content formats directly influences the downstream operation
            possibly on the visualization data, since different content formats
            have their own advantages and disadvantages.

            Now that we have considered the different content formats of raw
            visualization data, the next challenge is its representation in AI
            approaches.
